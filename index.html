                <p>Web development can be broken down into three layers: client-side coding (frontend), server-side

                    <p>Client-side scripting, or frontend development, refers to everything that the end user
                        experiences directly. Client-side code executes in a web browser and directly relates to
                        what
                        people see when they visit a website.</p>
